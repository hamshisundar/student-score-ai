# Student Score AI – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning system
for predicting student exam scores using structured educational data.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Playground Series (Season 6 – Episode 1)
- Task: Regression (exam_score prediction)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing using One-Hot Encoding and ColumnTransformer
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation using RMSE
- External benchmarking via Kaggle leaderboard

## Files
- `student_score_prediction.ipynb` – Full Kaggle ML pipeline
- Figures used in the academic report
- Kaggle submission artifacts

## Results
- Validation RMSE ≈ 9.04
- Kaggle Public Score ≈ 9.15
